## explanation of this system

I want to automate transcribing audio to text using GCP Speech Api.
This system is planned for the purpose.

GCP Speech API needs long audio file to put in Google Cloud Storage（GCS）.
This API can't process stereo audio and specific audio（ex.mp3）.
So, in addition to automate uploading audio to GCS, pre-treatment pipeline which convert audio to suitable format is needed.

All cloud resources for the purpose shall be generated by Terraform, using main.tf of this repository.
I also wrote python script to detect generating audio file at specific directory and to suitable pipeline depends on audio format.

## preparation

* Create AWS and GCP account, and generate IAM and credentials to controll each cloud resources.
	* This architecture is consist of resources as bellow.
		* AWS：S3, Lambda, Elastic Transcoder
		* GCP：Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Speech API
* Install Terraform on your PC, and define environmental variables which are suitable for the credentials of AWS and GCP
	* AWS: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html
	* GCP: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/google/index.html
* Distribute local-pc-resources/watchdog_rpi.py to your device for recording talking.
    * Using not python2 but python3 to execute watchdog_rpi.py.
	* Installing libralies using local-pc-resources/requirements.txt on the device.
	* Doing yum install ffmpeg or avconv may be required for Pydub(one of the python libraries).
	* Define environmental variables is also needed for executing python script.
		* AWS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html
		* GCP: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production
* Unzip transfer-s3flac-to-gcs.zip, modify gcp-develop-key.json according to your actual GCP project and rezip these files. 
* Doing terraform apply to generate all cloud resources.
* Some minor adjustment is needed for two scripts
	* watchdog_rpi.py: change gcs and s3 bucket name to generated bucket name
	* transcribe-flac-to-text(generated Cloud Function): change gcs bucket name of putting translated text to generated bucket name
